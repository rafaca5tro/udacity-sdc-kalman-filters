> **Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree** -- Extended Kalman Filters

Extended Kalman Filter implementation for sensor fusion combining lidar and radar measurements to track a moving object's position and velocity.

---

## Key Concepts

- Kalman filter prediction and update steps
- Sensor fusion (lidar + radar)
- Jacobian matrix computation
- RMSE evaluation
- uWebSocketIO simulator interface

---

## Getting Started

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
./ExtendedKF
```
